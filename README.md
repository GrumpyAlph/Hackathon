<h2 align="center"><i>The First AI Powered Oracle on Alephium</i></h2>

### What is Grumpy Fortunes?
Grumpy Fortunes is the first AI-driven price prediction oracle on the Alephium blockchain, but don't let the serious tech fool you—Grumpy's a bit of a jokester! Our custom oracle contract and scheduled task run smoothly in the background to gather and analyze historical price data from CoinGecko. (We're planning to expand to more data sources soon—stay tuned!) Every day at the market close, we collect and store price data. This data is then processed by our AI to predict prices for 24 hours, 7 days, and 1 month ahead. These predictions, along with Alephium's current price and the prediction date, are saved on the blockchain for use by Grumpy or any other curious contracts.

And yes, the oracle contract includes a "map" function, so you can even request historical price predictions. Nostalgia, anyone?

### What is an oracle?
In ancient times:
> A wise figure (often a priestess) believed to speak on behalf of the gods, delivering divine prophecies and predictions. (www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/oracle)

In crypto:
> Blockchain oracles are like bridges between blockchains and the real world. They connect smart contracts to external data sources, so decisions can be made based on real-world events. While oracles don't generate the data themselves, they verify and relay it, allowing blockchains to interact with external systems.

### So, what about Grumpy Fortune?
Grumpy Fortunes is way more than just a price oracle! Modeled after the famous Zoltar fortune-telling machines, Grumpy delivers price predictions with his unique brand of sarcasm. The system retrieves predictions from our oracle contract and then sends them back to the AI. The result? Grumpy adds a sassy, often sarcastic comment to brighten your day (or ruin your hopes). Plus, we’ve thrown in some entertainment while you're waiting for the transaction to confirm. After all, why settle for boring when you’ve got Grumpy?

### Summary
Grumpy Fortunes is both a cutting-edge AI-powered oracle and a fun twist on the old-school fortune teller machine. Get your predictions, but don't take them too seriously—unless you enjoy financial advice from a grumpy cat!
